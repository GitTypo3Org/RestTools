ExtendingSphinxForTYPO3 is a Python package that extends the capabilities
of Sphinx specifically for TYPO3. 

Currently this package can only be installed and does nothing by itself.
It provides the 'typo3sphinx' theme that will automatically be found by
other software.

Installation
------------
To install go to the directory ./ExtendingSphinxForTYPO3 with the 
setup.py file and run 'python setup.py install'.

At the commandline::

  $ cd ./ExtendingSphinxForTYPO3
  $ python setup.py install

or maybe

  $ cd ./ExtendingSphinxForTYPO3
  $ sudo python setup.py install

End.
